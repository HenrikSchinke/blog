<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>To explain the reason for this blog post, I want to use an analogy. Letâ€™s think of data analysis as we would be building a house. Ideally, you design your blueprint and then build the house of your dreams. But in nearly 100 % of the cases, this will not happen. Most likely, there will be a rough idea and a draft rather than a true well structured workflow. You will build your house, then look at it and finally decide you want a different roof. Because you are in the process, your (R-)environment looks quite messy and you are not certain of all your intermediate steps. Thus, you decide to re-build everything from scratch and, at the last step, replace the roof with the new one.</p>

</div>
<p>If your blueprint (analysis) is quite complex, your machine might take a while to re-build your house. This can not only be time consuming but also confusing and frustrating.</p>
<p>So instead of burning down everything, why not just remove the old roof and add a new one on top? This would make things a lot easier to follow up and much faster to get to your final results.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wlandau?tab=repositories">Will Landau</a> wrote an R package called <a href="https://books.ropensci.org/drake/">Drake</a> to do exactly that and much more. Recently, I started using Drake and I do not want to miss it anymore. Even though, Drake means adding yet another layer of complexity to your code, the benefits are justifying the initial addition of complexity.</p>
<p>With this post, I want to give a brief look at my personal highlights of Drake. For sure, I am still only scratching the surface of this powerful package.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-drake" class="section level2">
<h2>What is Drake?</h2>
<p>Will Landau and colleagues came up with a nice introduction and even a talk about Drake. Click <a href="https://books.ropensci.org/drake/">here</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Essentially, Drake is a package organizing and streamlining your workflow for you. It realizes which part of your analysis was changed and re-calculates only this part and downstream dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-using-drake" class="section level2">
<h2>Why using Drake?</h2>
<p>Well, all good things come in threes. So, here I will list my main three reasons why I think you should use Drake.</p>
<div id="functions-functions-and-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>1- Functions, functions and functions</h3>
<p>The first few steps with Drake might be a little rough, especially if you are not an R-expert yet. But this is already a good argument for using Drake; especially in the beginning when coding, you will probably code your calculations, then copy-paste, and slightly re-adjust the same calculation for a different data set. Often, this will lead to bloated R-scripts and a messy workspace, making it hard to keep track of the workflow. Drake wants one R-script containing all your data munging steps as functions. This forces you to really think in a generalized manner and avoids essentially repetitive code chunks.</p>
</div>
<div id="dependency-graph" class="section level3">
<h3>2- Dependency graph</h3>
<p>And here comes the next synergistic feature; since all your data munging will be structured in one R-script, Drake needs you to write a plan about when and where to apply your functions. This plan can be visualized as an interactive dependency graph. In the default HTML-output file, you may re-shuffle your objects and functions. Drake even tells you the time spent for calculation. I use this dependency graph to examine and explain my workflow to colleagues and superiors. Here, I posted a static workflow example of an analysis on RNASeq data I am currently doing. If your actually creating your on depency graph with <code>vis_drake_graph()</code> it will be an interactive HTML-file.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Static example of Dependency Graph</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="time-saver" class="section level3">
<h3>3- Time saver</h3>
<p>Within the dependency graph, outdated items are marked. Drake understands which steps have been outdated, deleted or are missing for whatever reason. To recall the introductory analogy; if you only want to change the roof of your house, Drake will realize that the basement and ground floor are still the same. Thus, only the roof will be re-build and added. As you may see in the dependency graph, parts of my workflow take minutes. So, running outdated steps only can be a massive time saver! What Drake does is that it creates a hidden cache. A good thing is that you may access your cache at any time by using the <code>readd()</code> or <code>loadd()</code> commands to look at an object of your workflow. With the command <code>r_drake_build(target = "XYZ")</code> you can furhter build specific target objects only. This makes you independent of the workspace restoring of R-Studio. In fact, when using Drake I would recommend to turn off the default mode of R-Studio in your project options.</p>

<h2>Further links</h2>
<p>Hopefully, the listed benefits of Drake are convincing enough to you to try it out. In the beginning, it may take a short while to adjust to the concepts of Drake, especially when you are sort of new to R and <a href="https://rstudio.com/">R-Studio</a>. But it is definitely worth the initial extra effort!</p>
<p>Besides the already mentioned <a href="https://books.ropensci.org/drake/visuals.html#underlying-graph-data-node-and-edge-data-frames">manual</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/blob/master/README.md">learndrake short course</a> has been added to the package. Further, Miles McBain wrote a <a href="https://milesmcbain.xyz/the-drake-post/">blog article</a> about Drake and Eric Nantz, the host of the R-podcast, uploaded an <a href="https://r-podcast.org/episode/022-diving-in-to-drake-with-will-landau/">episode</a> with Will Landau covering Drake.</p>
